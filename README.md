Another one of my old programs. This one's fun. Send it to your best friend or someone who's pissed you off

- Keeps popping annoying windows and boxes with stupid messages
- Disables regedit
- Disables taskmgr
- Keeps sending BACKSPACE so user can't really type his way out
- Copies itself to Startup folder
- Consumes RAM and CPU
